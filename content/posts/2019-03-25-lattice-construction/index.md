For condensed matter physics, we will need to obtain lattice information like nearest neighbor bond for constructing of Hamiltonian.

Here I will propose the functions that a lattice library should have and how we implement them.

# Generate grid

# Boundary condition

# Supercell

# Symmetry

# Brillouin zone and Fourier transformation

# High symmetry point and lines
